Labyrinth  - Low poly fps game, with an abandoned prison-island theme

	Early goals:
		focus on basic movement mechanics
		collision detection between bullets->enemies, enemy_bullets->player, enemies->player, player->walls
			No jump initially so that player's height is static--no gravity needed unless we make it to that point at which time we would implement jump and floor collision
		integration of graphic features discussed in class
			Emissive bullets!
			Shadows
			Normal mapped walls
			Reflective pools of water
			Use darkness and light sources as a game mechanic
				Player has a flashlight/spotlight 
					Powered by battery that is replenished when not in use.
			Explosions that use particle effects
			Enemies that shoot at you
			Enemies that deal contact damage
			
			
	Late goals:
		Procedurally generated floors
		Weapons of varying strength and effect
		Variety of enemies
